Unistyles ships with own mocks that will help you to test your components that consume `useStyles` and `createStyleSheet`.

### Using mocks

In order to use the library mocks you need to either use `jest` or set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `test`.

```json /NODE_ENV=test/
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-native start",
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test vitest"
},
```
Alternatively, you can import your Unistyles themes into `jest.setup.js`.
```js
// jest.setup.js
import '../unistyles';
```

### NativeEventEmitter

To mock `NativeEventEmitter` that is imported internally from `react-native` you can use the following code:

1. Create `jest.setup.js` file:

```javascript /NativeEventEmitter/
jest.mock('react-native/Libraries/EventEmitter/NativeEventEmitter');
```

2. If you use `jest.config.js`:

```diff lang="js"
module.exports = {
    preset: 'react-native',
+    setupFiles: ['./jest.setup.js'],
};
```

3. If you use `jest` in `package.json`:

```diff lang="json"
{
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native",
+    "setupFiles": ["./jest.setup.js"]
  }
}
```

### Testing on web with JSDOM

When utilizing JSDOM for testing purposes, it is required to provide the implementation 
for `window.matchMedia`, as this functionality is absent in JSDOM, yet it is a dependency for Unistyles.

For a comprehensive approach, refer to the official `jest` documentation on [mocking methods that are not implemented in JSDOM](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks#mocking-methods-which-are-not-implemented-in-jsdom).
### Support

Mocks support basic operations and are designed to mimic the setting of themes and breakpoints. 
However, some operations, such as using `plugins` or `adaptiveThemes`, are not supported.
