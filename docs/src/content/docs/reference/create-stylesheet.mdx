Utility for building your `StyleSheets` with superpowers.
It can be imported from the `react-native-unistyles`:

```ts
import { createStyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'
```

This tool is interchangeable with React Native's `StyleSheet.create`.

`crateStyleSheet` accepts both `object` or `function`.

### Basic usage (object)

If you pass an object to the `createStyleSheet` it will work the same like with `StyleSheet.create`.
With this tool you can now use [variants](/reference/variants/), [breakpoints](/reference/breakpoints/) and
[media queries](/reference/media-queries/).

```ts
const stylesheet = createStyleSheet({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
    },
})
```

### Basic usage (function)

When you pass a function to `createStyleSheet` it automatically injects a `theme` as the first argument for you.

To register your themes please follow [setup](/start/setup/) and [theming](/reference/theming/) guides.

```ts /theme/
const stylesheet = createStyleSheet(theme => ({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background
    },
}))
```

In addition to the `theme` argument, you can also accept the `runtime` argument when passing a function. This can be useful for accessing `UnistylesRuntime` and its properties (such as screen orientation, dimensions, insets, and more) without having to import this class directly.

```ts /runtime/
const stylesheet = createStyleSheet((theme, runtime) => ({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        paddingTop: runtime.insets.top,
        backgroundColor: runtime.orientation === 'portrait'
            ? theme.colors.accent
            : theme.colors.oak
    },
}))
```

Since version 2.8.0, the library will inject `mini runtime` which is a subset of the original `UnistylesRuntime` without methods like `setTheme` or `setRootViewBackgroundColor`, which are not useful when defining your stylesheets.


Importantly, you'll receive the same TypeScript hints as with `StyleSheet.create`!
